Barcelona Airbnb Machine Learning Project:
This is a machine learning project for PSTAT 131, Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning at UCSB. The project uses a data set from Kaggle, containing data on Airbnb's in Barcelona, Spain. The dataset can be found here:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zakariaeyoussefi/barcelona-airbnb-listings-inside-airbnb?select=barcelona_listings.csv) on the Kaggle website. The outcome is predicting the nightly price of the Airbnb based on factors like number of bedrooms, neighborhood, and number of reviews on Airbnb.
